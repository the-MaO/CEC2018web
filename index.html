After a wave of integration into the European Union, OECD and World Trade Organisation, the Great Recession shook the elementary foundations of the economic reality. Due to Slovakia's decision to accept Euro in 2009, the response to the crisis and paths since have been different, yet both countries have since managed moderate economic growth rates. If we say that the financial system is healthy, why are the interest rates still so low? Was Slovakia right to accept Euro and should the Czech Republic follow suit? What will the challenges of the future, such as aging population or robotization bring for the financial system of the Central Europe? </p>

Often referred to as the “factory of Europe”, the region employs a significant share of its population in the automobile sector and the transformations that it is currently undergoing will thus have considerable social and economic implications. On the other hand, we are witnessing a boom in technological and scientific innovation within the sector which is likely to play an increasingly important role. Is there an optimal balance between manufacturing and innovation in the sector? How will the transformations impact the sector and the economies of the region as a whole?</p>

According to Hlídací Pes, there are over 40 media outlets in Czech Republic alone that actively spread fake news. They describe themselves as independent, claim to provide objective information, but simultaneously accuse the mainstream media and politicians of acting against the interests of their citizens. They often churn out content that is pro-Kremlin, praise those who reverberate Moscow’s interpretation of events, and denigrate those with pro-Western views. These platforms pose an unprecedented threat to the region: they create social bubbles with an echo-chamber effect, widen splits in society, and fuel their readers’ distaste for different opinions and constructive public discourse. As a result, our society today is more divided than it has ever been since the fall of the Communist regime in 1989.</p>

Although the issue has been present for decades, there has been little progress in the area and the question of Roma inclusion is often ignored or inappropriately tackled on a structural level. Despite some recent efforts on the government and third sector level (Teach for Slovakia, Strategy 2020) and widespread pressure from international institutions, the Roma minority has seen little progress over the years. What are the success stories and how can we learn from them? How can we ensure that Roma minorities have equal agency in the discussion and what are the expert views on the most effective solutions?</p>

		    								Pavel Fischer served as a political advisor to the late President Vaclav Havel and the Director of the Political and Analytical Department of President Havel's Presidential Office for Mr Havel's two consecutive terms. Subsequently, he was appointed as the Ambassador of the Czech Republic to France. After his 7-year ambassadorial mission, he served as the Political Director General in charge of defence, security and strategic issues at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic. In 2013, he stepped down for family reasons in connection with the deteriorating health state of his son and worked with governmental and non-governmental partners. Mr. Fischer has generally been acknowledged as one of the leading supporters of strong Trans-Atlantic ties, as well as an active membership of the Czech Republic in the NATO and EU among the politically active figures. In 2018 Presidential election, he came 3rd in the first round with more than half a million votes. Pavel Fischer studied public administration at École nationale d'administration in France and French and Czech languages at Charles University.

		    								Martin Milan Šimečka is a writer, public intellectual and journalist at the Denník N newspaper. Born into the family of prominent dissident and philosopher Milan Šimečka, he was forbidden to study at the university during the socialist period and until 1989 worked as a manual labourer. However, from an early age, he became a prominent figure among Slovak literary dissent, publishing in samizdat, thus later becoming one of the key figures of the Velvet Revolution. In 1990 he founded the publishing house Archa and later was the Editor-in-chief of magazine Domino-fórum, then SME daily newspaper and Czech magazine Respekt.
											His most prominent works include novels Džin and Záujem, and recent book Medzi Slovákmi: Stručné dejiny ľahostajnosti od Dubčeka k Ficovi. (Between Slovaks: A short history of indifference from Dubček to Fico). Martin M. Šimečka is the recipient of the Pegasus Prize for Literature (2003) and Order of Ludovit Stur, 1st Class, a high state award of Slovak Republic.

                      Barbora Babicova studied the pedagogy of Slovak language, literature and history. For four years, she taught at Slovak high schools in regions characterised by high unemployment rate as well as high Roma share of the population. Her students thus included also Roma children, where she experienced that although the children were in many cases very bright, she, as a teacher, needed to pay significant attention to the living conditions in which these children were growing up. Since 2015, Barbora works as an editor of the magazine “Dobrá škola”, and is involved in training the future teachers in Teach for Slovakia. She is also involved in the NGO Eduma, where she is responsible for teacher training using the methods of online live books and storytelling. She aims to prepare teachers for working with vulnerable social groups, as well as to prepare them for teaching children in terms of tolerance and fighting stereotypes and prejudices.
